A buyer of Blue coin 100 @ 1.04  Dai ( 4% swap rate/ expected inflation) (4% over collateral)
--system got 104 Dai 
B buyer of RC 100 @ 1.1 (10% collateral)
--sytem got 110 Dai

1)after 1 year (Actual Inflation is 7%)

A redeme Dai 1.07 @ 100 
-- system need to return 107 Dai to A
B redeme Dai (100*0.97 + 10)110-3 = 107
-- system need to return 107 Dai to B


2)after 1 year inflation 3%
A redeme Dai 1.03 @ 100 
-- system need to return 103 Dai to A
B redeme Dai 110+1 = 111
-- system need to return 111 Dai to B


Reserve pool will be invested/Yield farming (214 Dai) on Compound or any other platform
  
Problem
1. Loss to Blue coin owner
2. if reserve coin buyer is not avaliable
3. over investement (104 dai)
